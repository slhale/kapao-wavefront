To use the application, run 
python -i TV5.py
then 
>>> telviz(‘directory/where/data/is/located’, ‘data_timestamp’)
from the appropriate directory. 


The requirements for this program are 
Files:
* TV5.py
* kapaolibplus.py
* Telemetry files to visualize
Other libraries:
* Numpy
* Astropy
* FFTW
* FTR


The file requirements can be downloaded from https://github.com/slhale/kapao-wavefront 


The python libraries required may be installed depending on operating system.


This code was written using astropy version 1.1.1, numpy version 1.10.4, and fftw version 3.3.4, but these specific versions are not necessarily required. 


If you do not have python installed, then you can install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Mac: 
For OS X you can install numpy and astropy using a package manager.


Numpy and pip (the package manager) may already be installed. You should also be able to use other package managers.


If you do not have pip installed, sudo easy_install pip


If you want to check which python packages you already have installed, then run  pip list
You can also check what versions of astropy and numpy you have with pip show astropy  or pip show numpy


Numpy: sudo pip install numpy


Astropy:  sudo pip install astropy


Before installing FTR, FFTW must be installed. FFTW cannot be installed with a package manager. You must instead download a tarball from http://www.fftw.org/download.html 
After unzipping the tarball, go into the directory and run  
./configure --enable-threads 
make
sudo make install


Then after installing FFTW, you may install FTR by 
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/alexrudy/ftr.git

Linux:
For Linux you can install all of the dependencies using your preferred package manager. 
Numpy may already be installed. 


If you are using apt-get, then run 
sudo apt-get install numpy
sudo apt-get install astropy


Before installing FTR, FFTW must be installed. 
FFTW may be installed with a package manager. If you do so, make sure to get the developer version.
You can also instead download a tarball from http://www.fftw.org/download.html 
After unzipping the tarball, go into the directory and run  
./configure
make
make install


Then after installing FFTW, you may install FTR by 
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/alexrudy/ftr.git
